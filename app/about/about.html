Often finding themselves in a heap of trouble that more often than not, was created through their own actions.</p>

            <p class="show-review">"Having seen the first two episodes I can tell you this much: the minds of Harmon and Roiland are special places to visit. And by special, I mean a little scary. But in an awesome, not easily explained sort of way." - Sabienna Bowman from TV Equals</p>
